Part 1 Ticket discount   
Tell the user that tickets cost 14 dollars. Then ask the user his age. If the user's age is <18 tell them that they can get a 10 dollar admission for being a minor, If the user’s age is >= 65, tell them that they can get a 10 dollar admission for being a senior citizen, lastly let them know if they have to pay full price. 

Part 2 Did I fail? 
Ask the user to input his score (1-100). If he is 90-100 tell him no you got an A!, if he is 80-89 tell him no you got a B!, if he is 70- 79 tell him it’s a C!, 60-69 it’s a D, 1-59 tell him Yeah you did fail, I’m sorry. 
Challenge: show you can do this with a switch-like statement too 

Part 3 How low? (loops) 
Write a program that prints out
how low low low low low 
can you go go go go go 
You are going to use a for loop on the first line to print the low word 5 times and a while loop on the second line the go word 5 times. 

Part 4 Guessing game (random and absolute) 
Write a program that does this: You (as programmer) are the dealer. Pick a random number for yourself (between 0 and 100). Ask the user to input a random number (between 0 and 100). Whoever is closer to 21 wins the game. If the dealer wins, say “Dealer wins.” If the user wins, say “Player wins”. 
Example output: 
Player please pick a number 
45 
Dealer has 25 Dealer wins. 

Part 5 Guessing game loop (keeping a counter) 
Write the same program as in part 4, but keep it going so that it keeps playing (dealing hands and saying who wins) until the User enters the number 21 at which point you print out some stats and say goodbye, for example, your goodbye might look like this: 
Number of hands played: 5 
Dealer won: 3 
Player won: 2 
You’re 2 for 5
